  The Single Source of Truth means that we can store the source of a repeated construct in one place and recycle and reuse it without ever actually duplicating it.
  Not establishing a relationship between unrelated rulesets
  *Mix ins without arguments are quite DRY (single source of truth)
  *Only use @extend when the rulesets that you are trying to DRY out are inherently and thematically related. Do not force relationships that do not exist: to do so will create unusual groupings in your project, as well as negatively impacting the source order of your code.

Possible File Structure
  *  /globals – contains Sass files that get applied site-wide like typography, colors, and grids
  *  /components – contains Sass files with component styles like buttons, tables, or input fields
  *  /sections – contains Sass files dedicated to specific pages or areas on a page (might work better combined into the /components/ folder)
  *  /utils – contains third-party utilities like Normalize that can be updated dynamically with tools like Bower.
  main.scss – the primary Sass file in the root folder that imports all others.
